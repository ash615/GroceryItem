    <!-- 1. git init (Initialize an Empty Git Repository).
         2. git clone repo-url (Clone/copy the remote repository into local machine).
         ( If I will download the zip folder the changes of commit will not be available)
         If we clone using the above command will have all the commits checkpoint available (in .git)....
         3. git add file-name (files to be considered while next commit)
            git commit -m "Commited...."
            git add . (moves all the newly modified file to staging area)
            git status
            git log (used for commit history checking)
            git checkout (commit id)
        (untracked file / modified file) :- new file created, move to staging area (git add <file-name>), once it is to staging area then commit.
        if new file created      

        4. If one want to push the changes to remote repository.
        git push <origin-name> <branch-name>

        5. git remote add origin <origin-name> (I added a reference to remote repository..., remote address)
        6. git push origin master. (pushing all content to the remote repository).
          By default, master brach is created
          
        7. downloading updates for remote repository.
           code . (It will open code in VS Code)
           git pull <origin-name> <branch-name>
           git pull origin master

        8. If I have remote repo and trying to do and push changes, directly it will not happen.
        First of all, pull for the remote repo first to local machine and then do change stage and then commit new change and finally push.
        
        9. Updates directly to the master branch is not recommended (it may lead to buggy code).
        master-> dev-> feature(1632, 1633, 1634) -> after feature I will(or any senior developer) merge changes to dev then to master
        jira ticket -> 1632 (I will create a branch jirafeature1632)
        (git checkout -b jira/1632) [New branch will be created and all code form master will be inherited exactly]
        similarly for any bug I can define a branch
